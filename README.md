# Unreal Engine 5 Global Environmental System (GES)

This system integrates Ultra Dynamic Sky Weather (potentially any Weather System) with Megascan Foliage, Trees, Props,  UE Water, Ambient Wind System, and various other Systems.
 
Note:  In this current version UDS is required and the only dependency. All the quxiel materials use UDS Wet Weather Effects.  But we should be able to use other Weather Systems such as Sky Creator I just have not done any of the integration or material integration for that yet.

Unreal Mapbox Bridge  -  Import real world locations into UE as Landscapes

Unreal Vault Organizer -  Organize your Unreal Vault with Tags and get update notifications

Texture From Mesh Creator - Creates a texture from a screen shot of a Mesh.  Main puporse for this was so I could easily capture the show print of my characters so I could stamp that texture into the landscape for footprint effects.
